## 📱 PWA Considerations

To make your app installable as a PWA, you can add:

1. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)
2. **Service Worker** for offline functionality
3. **Meta tags** for mobile optimization

## 🔍 Post-Deployment

After deployment:

1. **Test all features:**
   - RSS feed loading
   - Tag filtering
   - Read/unread functionality
   - Category management

2. **Check mobile responsiveness:**
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify sidebar behavior on mobile

3. **Monitor performance:**
   - Use browser dev tools
   - Check loading times
   - Verify CORS proxy functionality

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build fails:**
- Check Node.js version (use 16+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for syntax errors

**CORS issues:**
- The app uses `api.allorigins.win` as a CORS proxy
- This should work on all platforms

**Assets not loading:**
- Verify build output in `dist` folder
- Check file paths in `index.html`

**Deployment not updating:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check deployment logs
- Verify Git push was successful

## 📊 Performance Tips

1. **Optimize images** if you add any
2. **Minimize bundle size** (already done by Vercel)
3. **Use CDN** for external resources
4. **Enable compression** (handled by hosting platforms)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS** is automatically provided by all platforms
2. **CORS** is handled by the proxy service
3. **No sensitive data** is stored locally
4. **RSS feeds** are public by nature

## 📈 Analytics (Optional)

To track usage, you can add:

**Google Analytics:**
- Add tracking code to `index.html`
- Monitor user engagement

**Netlify Analytics:**
